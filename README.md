# How to set up Arma 3: A complete guide

This guide will cover:
- How to install Arma 3 and mods
- How to install TeamSpeak3
- How to install Radmin VPN
- How to familiarize yourself with the game

Be sure to follow the steps in this guide WELL BEFORE (a few days) the op so that we can diagnose issues.

***I WILL NOT HELP YOU SET ANYTHING UP IF YOU DO IT RIGHT BEFORE WE PLAY (and I will not let Matt help you either, I want him to play).***

## ARMA 3 INSTALL GUIDE

To install Arma 3, use Steam like you normally would to install a game. You may want to consider putting the game on an SSD to shorten loading times and to make your framerate smoother, but be warned that the size of the game will be 75GB+ after mods are installed.

There are a few things you might want to change after you install the game. These are optional but highly recommended.
- Turn off mouse smoothing. From the main menu, go to Settings>Controls>Mouse>Mouse Smoothing. Turn it all the way off.
- Change your profile name. By default this is set to your Windows username. On the main menu, go up to the top right and hover over the little person symbol. Click on the name that appears. On this menu, create a new profile and name it as you wish. You can also customize your default player head.

## RADMIN GUIDE

Radmin VPN is the VPN we use to connect to each other.

1. Install it by downloading here.
2. Once installed join the network `LSS-Network-2`. There is no password, leave it blank.
3. The main PC you will be connecting to is `LSS-Server-2`. Its IP is `26.198.191.53`.

## MODS INSTALL GUIDE

Alright, so you've got the game installed. Now to install the mods.

1. Download the modlist [here](https://github.com/resdek-lss/a3-guide/blob/a757080ad5d2a18bef8997db74d2400d455e1d87/Arma%203%20Preset%20LSS%20Modlist.html) (click on the "download raw file" button on the right side of the page). This is a .html file that you will use in a moment.
2. Open the Arma 3 Launcher.
3. On the top right of the launcher window, click on the arrow next to "Preset". On the bottom of that pane, hit "Import". Find the .html file you just downloaded and select it. The game will now automatically detect those mods.
4. Make sure the mods from the modlist are enabled. You can do this by opening that "Preset" menu and selecting the "LSS Modlist" you just installed.
5. Whenever you want to play, press "Play (with mods)"!

That's your mods installed! If I ask, the secret phrase is `butterbean`.

However, there is one additional step for the mod install. The VOIP mod Arma uses (TFAR) requires TeamSpeak3, an older VOIP program. Here's how to install it and the TeamSpeak add-on for TFAR.

1. Go to the TeamSpeak download page [here](https://www.teamspeak.com/en/downloads/#ts3client). Yes, you want the `Windows Client 64-Bit`.
2. Run the executable.
3. When proceeding through the executable, do not install "Official TeamSpeak Overlay: Overwolf" or whatever it asks you about. It's a legit program (its not malware or anything) but it does kinda suck ass.
4. When you launch TeamSpeak, it will ask you to make an account. This is optional (I don't recommend it, it's useless) so just hit "Continue without account" or whatever it says.
5. Enter your desired nickname for TS.
6. In TS, hit the "Bookmarks" button > "Manage bookmarks"
7. Add a new bookmark, call it what you like (i.e. "LSS Server"). Set the "Server Nickname or Address" to that of the server computer in Radmin: `26.198.191.53`.
8. Set the server password as `bingbong123`. Leave the next two fields blank.
9. Hit OK.
10. To connect to the server, go back to your bookmarks tab and click on the server.

Now, to install the TFAR addon.
1. Download it from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q2VW-lWx-FFAugDFIRjB50OrA42r2q1a/view?usp=sharing).
2. Make sure TeamSpeak is closed. Simply execute the plugin file, which should install it.
3. To double check it is enabled, go to your TeamSpeak -> Tools -> Options -> Addons -> Plugins -> Task Force Arrowhead Radio. Make sure it says "Enabled".

And you should be good to go!

## HOW TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE GAME

Arma is a very complex game, so I **strongly, strongly recommend playing a bit before the first op**. There's a lot of keybinds and gameplay mechanics to understand.

The best way to learn initially is by doing the in-game tutorials/campaigns. To play these, first **launch your game without any mods**. You can do this in the launcher by clicking the arrow next to the "Play" button and selecting "Play without mods and optional DLC" (alternatively, launch the game with only the JSRS soundmod for a better audio experience). On the main menu, go to Singleplayer -> Campaigns -> "Prologue" -> "Reality Check". The game might ask you to start this when launching or when pressing the campaign button as well.

By going through that campaign (which is pretty short, around 45m-1h or so), you should have a basic feel for vanilla Arma.

Now, there will be several mods that you'll need to get the hang of for the op. For this reason, we'll be doing a few training sessions whenever people are available. This will also be a time to make sure everyone can join the server and that everyone's radio mods work properly.

And just let me know when you wanna hop in! I'll do my best to help you get stuff up and working.

## JOINING THE SERVER

When it comes time to play on the server, here's how to join:

- On the main menu, go to Multiplayer>Direct Connect
- Enter the server IP as found in Radmin: `26.198.191.53`.
- Enter the password: `bingbong123`.
- Hit join.

## INTRODUCTION TO THE ZEUS GAMEMODE

The gamemode we will be playing is called Zeus. Essentially, it is a DnD style gamemode where a Game Master controls the mission as it progresses. This allows for a lot of flexibility in contrast to ordinary missions - the scenario will change constantly according to your actions, and no playthrough is the same.

Zeus missions, in our group at least, usually will follow a similar format: everyone gets in the game, gears up, is deployed to the AO, completes the mission, and then exfil to end the mission.

While very fun, the gamemode also comes with more responsibility on behalf of the players and the Game Master. It takes a while to get things set up properly as the GM, so I politely ask that you ***refrain from being needlessly destructive***. Accidents will happen, of course. But don't make things harder for me or your teammates.

This time around, we're trying to run a slightly more immersive game. I'm not asking for *heavy* roleplay, but try to keep things relatively tame. Please don't shoot friendly personnell or assets (teammates, AI, or otherwise) constantly.

## SQUAD ROLES

Now, be thinking about what role you'd like to play on the team! Here's a few roles that might need to be played. We'll have a roster up on Discord soon so you can claim what role you'd like to play. We'll have one of these for any future ops too, if there are any.

- Squad lead (taken for sure)
- Machinegunner
- Marksman
- AT Specialist
- AA Specialist
- Explosive Specialist
- Medic
- Engineer
