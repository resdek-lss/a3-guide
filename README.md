***I WILL NOT HELP YOU SET ANYTHING UP IF YOU DO IT RIGHT BEFORE WE PLAY (and I will not let Matt help you either, I want him to play).***

## ARMA 3 INSTALL GUIDE

To install Arma 3, use Steam like you normally would to install a game. You may want to consider putting the game on an SSD to shorten loading times and to make your framerate smoother, but be warned that the size of the game will be 75GB+ after mods are installed.

There are a few things you might want to change after you install the game. These are optional but highly recommended.
- Turn off mouse smoothing. From the main menu, go to Settings>Controls>Mouse Smoothing. Turn it off.
- Change your profile name. By default this is set to your Windows username. On the main menu, go up to the top right and press the little person symbol. On this menu, create a new profile and name it as you wish. You can also customize your default player head.

## RADMIN GUIDE

Radmin VPN is the VPN we use to connect to each other.

1. Install it by downloading here.
2. Once installed join the network `LSS-Network-2`. There is no password, leave it blank.
3. The main PC you will be connecting to is `LSS-Server-2`. It's IP is `26.198.191.53`.

## MODS INSTALL GUIDE

Alright, so you've got the game installed. Now to install the mods.

1. Download the modlist here: <link>. This is a .html file that you will use in a moment.
2. Open the Arma 3 Launcher
3. On the top right of the launcher window, click on the arrow next to "Preset". On the bottom of that pane, hit "Import". Find the .html file you just downloaded and select it. The game will now automatically detect those mods.
4. Close the Preset pane. When the mods have all downloaded, make sure they are all enabled with a checkmark. If they aren't, you should be able to press "Load all" on the right side of the window (if you haven't installed any other mods, that is).
5. Whenever you want to play, press "Play (with mods)"!

That's your mods installed! If I ask, the secret phrase is `butterbean`.

However, there is one additional step for the mod install. The VOIP mod Arma uses (TFAR) requires TeamSpeak3, an older VOIP program. Here's how to install it and the TeamSpeak add-on for TFAR.

1. Go to the TeamSpeak download page here: <link>. Yes, you want the "Windows Client 64-Bit".
2. Run the executable.
3. When proceeding through the executable, do not install "Official TeamSpeak Overlay: Overwolf" or whatever it asks you about. It's a legit program (its not malware or anything) but it does kinda suck ass.
4. When you launch TeamSpeak, it will ask you to make an account. This is optional (I don't recommend it, it's useless) so just hit "Continue without account" or whatever it says.
5. Enter you nickname for TS.
6. In TS, hit the "Bookmarks" button > "Manage bookmarks"
7. Add a new bookmark, call it what you like (i.e. "LSS Server"). Set the "Server Nickname or Address" to that of the server computer in Radmin: `26.198.191.53`.
8. Set the server password as `bingbong123`. Leave the next two fields blank.
9. Hit OK.
10. To connect to the server, go back to your bookmarks tab and click on the server.

Now, to install the TFAR addon.
1. Download it from here.
2. Make sure TeamSpeak is closed. Simply execute the plugin file, which should install it.
3. To double check it is enabled, go to your TeamSpeak -> Tools -> Options -> Addons -> Plugins -> Task Force Arrowhead Radio. Make sure it says "Enabled".

And you should be good to go!
